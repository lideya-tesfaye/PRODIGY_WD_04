        <p class="text">My name is Lideya Tesfaye, and I am a passionate third-year student at Jimma University, 
            where I am diligently pursuing a degree in computer science. Throughout my studies, I have cultivated a 
            solid proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing me to design and develop dynamic and visually 
            appealing web applications.

            Currently, I am fully engaged in a variety of online courses, which are enriching my knowledge and skills 
            in front-end programming. I am also actively applying what I learn through hands-on projects that challenge 
            my creativity and problem-solving abilities. These projects not only reinforce my coding skills but also 
            provide me with practical experience in building real-world applications.
            
            Moreover, I am deeply motivated to expand my horizons by learning Python and exploring the fascinating
             world of data science. This aspiration to broaden my expertise is driven by my desire to equip myself
              with diverse skills that are essential in today's technology-driven environment. I believe that mastering 
              these areas will not only enhance my technical proficiency but also empower me to tackle complex challenges
               and contribute meaningfully to the field of computer science.
            
            I am committed to lifelong learning and am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as I continue
             to grow and develop as a tech professional. </p>
